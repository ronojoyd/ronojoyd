# Hey there 👋 I'm Ronojoy.

I’m a junior at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science, specializing in Devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently, I’m on track to graduate by December 2025. 

<u>**Personal Projects**<u>

Over the past summer, I’ve been diving deeper into Node.js/Express backend development through courses on **The Odin Project** while simultaneously working on my own web projects. I've also been learning **Cloud Fundamentals** as I prepare to earn my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. In addition, I've dedicated time to learning how to work with **Arduinos**, guided by some amazing community resources on YouTube.

One of my favorite personal projects I've been developing is **a productivity app**. Although I've tried many different “to-do list” apps, I sometimes struggle with time management—spending too much time on certain tasks while neglecting others, and even working past my bedtime and messing up my sleep schedule. To solve this, I’ve been creating a productivity app that shows a live timer counting down to bedtime (so I can mentally gauge how much time I have left to work), a structured task manager to add/remove tasks and track the time spent on each, and a daily task queue to help me focus on a few key tasks each day instead of getting overwhelmed by everything on my plate. There’s much more to this app, and it’s definitely a work in progress, but I’d love to add some LLM-based features to give it more personality (literally, like Duolingo) and integrate third-party calendar apps.
