# Hey there 👋 I'm Ronojoy.

I’m a **junior at Georgia Tech** studying **Computer Science** with a focus on **Devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and I’m set to graduate by December 2025. Outside my academic and technical work, I’m a history buff who loves reading just about any historical book, and baking banana bread 🍞 is my favorite way to unwind.

<u>**Work Experience**<u>

During my time at General Motors, I had the chance to dive into a variety of projects, from full-stack development to learning something entirely new: CI/CD pipelines. One of the highlights was developing a game application inspired by Pokémon Go. We put a lot of thought into features like streaks and daily points to keep employees engaged, and it was rewarding to see it catch on. But the work didn’t stop there.

I was also tasked with developing CI/CD tools for a crucial microservice-based software application used in vehicle manufacturing. This application was a big deal: it saved GM $50 per vehicle, which really added up. Automating the deployment process was essential to avoid the headaches of manual deployments and save our team countless hours. Figuring out how to automate configurations with Python and Bash scripting was challenging, but seeing the time and effort it saved made it all worthwhile.

Whether I was building a game or streamlining a manufacturing process, I found myself driven by the challenge of solving problems and making technology work better for people. I also had the opportunity to work with the Richmond Public Defenders, where I transformed a dense legal handbook into an interactive resource hub, making the legal process easier for clients to navigate. And during my research at Virginia Commonwealth University, I tackled real-world problems using data and machine learning, from optimizing vaccine distribution to managing lockdown policies with reinforcement learning. (My research repo [to learn more](https://github.com/ronojoyd/research-work) has more details) Across these experiences, what ties everything together is my love for problem-solving—whether it’s simplifying a complex process or finding the best way to make technology truly useful (and possible fun) for people.


<u>**Personal Projects**<u>

Over the past summer, I’ve been diving deeper into Node.js/Express backend development through courses on [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) while simultaneously working on my own web projects. I've also been learning **Cloud Fundamentals** as I prepare to earn my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. In addition, I've dedicated time to learning how to work with [**Arduinos**](https://github.com/ms-iot), guided by some amazing community resources on YouTube.

**I'm currently working on two personal projects.** The first project I’m developing is a [**Productivity App**](https://github.com/ronojoyd/productivity-app). Although I've tried many different “to-do list” apps, I sometimes struggle with time management, spending too much time on certain tasks while neglecting others, and sometimes even working past my bedtime and messing up my sleep schedule. To solve this, I’ve been creating a productivity app that shows a live timer counting down to bedtime (so I can mentally gauge how much time I have left to work), a structured task manager to add/remove tasks and track the time spent on each, and a daily task queue to help me focus on a few key tasks each day instead of getting overwhelmed by everything on my plate. There’s much more to this app, and it’s definitely a work in progress, but I’d love to add some LLM-based features to give it more personality (literally, like Duolingo) and integrate third-party calendar apps.

The other project is a [**Spotify Jukebox**](), born out of a simple need: making party music easier. I wanted an app that lets my friends and me set up a temporary jukebox for parties without the hassle of creating playlists or juggling multiple Spotify accounts, especially since some of my friends use Apple Music. With this app, we can manage the music using just one person’s account, making it straightforward for everyone. I worked on a similar project earlier as part of Georgia Tech's Web Dev Club, where I developed a jukebox application with a larger team using SST and AWS DynamoDB. However, this current project is a personal endeavor where I’m adding my own unique touches.

_The frontend of both applications still needs significant work, even though the backends are largely functional and running smoothly on MongoDB._
